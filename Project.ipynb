    "#### Motivations\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most interesting challenges in AI is the problem of knowledge representation. Representing everyday facts and relationships in a form that computers can work with has proven to be difficult with traditional computer science methods. The  basic problem is that our knowledge of the world  is not divided into discrete facts with well-defined relationships. Almost everything we know  has exceptions, and the relationships between concepts are too numerous and ill-defined to map onto traditional computer data structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "Brains do not have this problem. They represent information using a method called Sparse Distributed Representations, or SDRs. SDRs and their mathematical properties are essential for biological intelligence. Everything the brain does and every principle described in this book is based on SDRs. SDRs are the language of the brain. The flexibility and creativity of human intelligence is inseparable from this representation method. Therefore, if we want intelligent machines to be similarly flexible and creative,they need to be based on the same representation method, SDRs. \n",
    "\n",
    "An SDR consists of thousands of bits where at any point in time a small percentage of the bits are 1’s and the rest are 0’s. The bits in an SDR correspond to neurons in the brain, a 1 being a relatively active neuron and a 0 being a relatively inactive neuron. The most important property of SDRs is that each bit has meaning. Therefore, the set of active bits in any  particular representation encodes the set of semantic attributes of what is being represented. The  bits are not labeled (that is to say, no one assigns meanings to the bits), but rather, the semantic meanings of bits are learned. If two  SDRs have active bits in  the same locations, they share the semantic attributes represented by those bits. By determining the overlap between two SDRs(the equivalent bits that are 1 in both SDRs) we can immediately see how two representations are semantically similar and how they are semantically different. Because of this semantic overlap property, systems based on SDRs automatically generalize based on semantic similarity.[[0]][Hawkins, J. et al. 2016. Biological and Machine Intelligence.]\n",

    "#### Key features of SDRs\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Only a small number of neurons (bits) are firing (=1) at any point in time\n",
    "2. There are a very large number of neurons (bits)\n",
    "3. Every bit represents something different and has meaning – semantically similar data will have large overlap in their SDR\n",
    "4. Information is distributed and no single neuron (bit) is critical\n",
    "5. SDRs enable extremely fast computation (All computations run linearly with the number of ON bits)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some further features to ponder...\n",
    "Think about why SDRs might be robust to noise. Why might it not matter if an SDR had a few bits missing/in a random position. Could you still tell what it was supposed to match? If it was matched wrongly, what would it likely be matched to?\n",

    "An encoder simply transforms some form of data into SDRs.\n",

    "There are a few rules to follow when writing an encoder:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Semantically similar input data should result in SDRs with overlapping active bits.\n",
    "2. The same input should always produce the same SDR as output.\n",
    "3. The output should have the same dimensionality (total number of bits) for all inputs.\n",
    "4. The  output should have similar sparsity for all inputs and have enough one-bits to handle noise and subsampling.[[2]][Hawkins, J. et al. 2016. Biological and Machine Intelligence.]\n",
